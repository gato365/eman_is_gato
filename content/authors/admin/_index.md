As an instructor at Cal Poly, we can select the statistical programming language 
we would like to perform statistical analyses, my first choice was R in which each student downloaded R and R Studio. The primary focus of my 10-week statistics course was statistical inference therefore I had to introduce the implementation of summary statistics, visualizations, and statistical techniques within R in a very non-traditional manner. This led me to create a library package named statcalpolypackage which included very straightforward functions to summarize and visualize data since I did not have time to teach the students elements of programming in R and the tidyverse. Though students were not using traditional functions to summarize data, they were given the confidence to learn how to analyze data within R. 

The students were given a project that they worked on throughout the quarter where I guided them through the process of learning statistics while analyzing their data set in R. This has turned out to work well because my past students have informed me that the skills learned in my class gave them the prowess to navigate R in their more advanced business courses that involved R. After watching Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel ’s introduction videos on R Studio Cloud, I have recently decided to move all my labs and classroom projects onto R Studio Cloud. I have found the ability to look at my students work without having to share screens or having the entire class download R and R Studio has been beneficial to my student’s learning experience.
